Task Management:
Kanban manages tasks continuously by moving them across columns with limits on work in progress, while Scrum organizes tasks into time-boxed sprints with a defined scope.

Workflows:
Kanban uses a continuous workflow that is flexible and visual. Scrum uses a sprint-based workflow, which is structured and time-bound. Scrum is easier to manage when deadlines are strict, while Kanban is easier for ongoing projects.

Flexibility:
Kanban is very flexible but may lack structure if not monitored. Scrum provides structure but can be rigid if tasks change mid-sprint.

Suitability:
For a real-world gallery website project, Scrum would work best if there are strict deadlines (such as an art event). Kanban would work best for long-term maintenance and gradual improvements.
